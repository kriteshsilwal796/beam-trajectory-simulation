# Beam Trajectory Simulation

This is a simple simulation of a charged particle moving through a uniform magnetic field.

The code shows how the particleâ€™s trajectory changes when the magnetic field strength, kinetic energy, mass, and charge are varied.

## How to Run

1. Install required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

2. Copy the code and run in the terminal:

```bash
python beam_trajectory.py
```
